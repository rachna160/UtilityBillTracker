# ⚡ Utility Bill Tracker: A Web3 Project

## 📜 Project Title
Utility Based Bill Tracker (UtilityBillTracker)

## 📝 Project Description
This project is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that uses a smart contract to *track, issue, and process utility bill payments* (e.g., electricity, water, gas). It replaces traditional, centralized payment systems with a transparent, secure, and auditable ledger on the blockchain.

## 🌟 Project Vision
To create a trustless, transparent, and efficient system for managing recurring utility payments, eliminating manual errors, reducing transaction disputes, and providing instantaneous verification of payment on a public ledger.

## ✨ Key Features
* *Decentralized Ledger:* All bill issuances and payment statuses are permanently recorded on the blockchain.
* *Trustless Payment:* The payBill function verifies the amount, updates the bill status, and transfers funds atomically.
* *Core Functions:*
    * addBill()
    * payBill()
    * isOverdue()

## 🔭 Future Scope
* *ERC-20 Payments:* Modify the contract to accept stablecoins (e.g., USDC, DAI) instead of native Ether.
* *Automated Usage Data:* Integrate with Oracles (like Chainlink) to automatically read and record meter readings and usage data.
* *UI Development:* Develop a front-end application (DApp) for consumers and providers to easily view, add, and pay bills via a wallet like MetaMask.
